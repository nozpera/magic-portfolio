# Data Cleaning and GUI Development for Job Roles in Canada Dataset

![Banner](/images/technical/project2/3.jpg)

[Follow this data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanbhattarai695/data-analyst-job-roles-in-canada)

#### Project Highlights:

**1. Real-Case Data Cleaning:** 
- Cleaned and processed the "Job Roles in Canada" dataset obtained from Kaggle.  
- Used regex to handle string inconsistencies and streamline the data cleaning process.  

**2. Handling Missing Values:**  
- Analyzed the original distribution of missing data, which followed a gamma distribution.  
- Imputed missing values using random sampling based on the original data's distribution.  

**3. Outlier Handling:**  
- Detected and handled outliers to ensure the dataset accurately represented the job market trends.  

**4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Implementation:**  
- Designed the entire data cleaning pipeline using class management in Python.  
- Utilized concepts such as:  
  - Instance Variables: For managing class-specific data attributes.  
  - Inheritance and Multi-Inheritance: To promote code reuse and modularity.  

**5. Modular Code Architecture:**  
- Encapsulated the entire project into Python modules (.py files).  
- Imported these modules into a `main.py` script for seamless data pipeline execution.  

**6. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development:**  
- Built a user-friendly GUI dashboard using Tkinter and CustomTkinter.  
- The dashboard presents analysis results and insights, making them accessible to non-technical stakeholders.  

**7. Planned Future Development:**  
- During this project, I realized that Streamlit offers a more robust solution for building real-time and interactive dashboards.  
- Future iterations of this project will leverage Streamlit to enhance the user experience.  
- Additionally, the next phase will extend to include machine learning modeling, providing actionable insights beyond the cleaned dataset.  
- **Stay tuned** for updates in the next project!  

**8. Deliverables:**  
- A cleaned dataset ready for further analysis or modeling.  
- A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the entire data cleaning process.  
- A video demonstration of the GUI interface, highlighting its usability and features.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
This project honed my technical and analytical skills while emphasizing the importance of presenting insights effectively to diverse audiences. It combines data engineering, software development, and data visualization to deliver impactful solutions.
